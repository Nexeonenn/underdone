As you level up in Underdone you gain Skill Points.
These can be used to unlock special upgrades.

You can unlock these upgrades in the "Ability" tab
When you have skill points to spend click this tab
and find the skill you would like to spec into.

Remember, it is wise to spec into upgrades that are
for the class type you are playing as.
It would be useless for a melee to spec into dexterity
as dexterity increases the damage from bullets and not
melee damage.

Note: Agility is a good upgrade to spec into early
on as it increases fire rate for both melee and gun.
