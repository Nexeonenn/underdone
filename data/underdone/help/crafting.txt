To craft items in Underdone you first need to know
the knowledge of what you are crafting, you learn
this knowledge through books that can be purchased
from the Library or given to you in quests.

Once you have read the book you can then select the
"CRAFTING" option from the main Inventory window
to the right of the Weight display.

Click a recipe you wish to craft and follow the
requirements to craft your item.

Note: Some recipes require you to be standing near
fire or the BBQ to craft.
